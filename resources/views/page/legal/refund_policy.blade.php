            <p>Due to the rules and regulations of the PRC and in compliance with the requirement of providers to report the details of participants completing each cours, 
                purchases through the Site are final unless we have informed you through a written notice to process a refund on your behalf.</p>
            <p>
                However, you can request within 7 days of your purchase of the course that FastCPD credit/refund your account through refunds@fastcpd.com, if the course you purchased 
                is not what you were expecting or you applied for or the course does not fall under your profession.  We reserve the right to apply for a credit or a refund, at our 
                discretion, depending on capabilities of our payment processing partners or the platform from which you purchased your course. You cannot request for refund if you request it 
                after the 7-day time limit has passed.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is at our discretion that we reserve the right to ban your account and to restrict all future use of the Services, if we believe you are abusing our credit/refund policy. If 
                we ban your account or disable your access to a course due to your violation of these Terms.
            </p>
            <p>
