            course to the students who enroll in the course. As a student, when you enroll in a course, whether it’s a free or paid course, you are getting from FastCPD a license to 
            view the course via FastCPD website, and FastCPD is the licensor of record. Courses are licensed, and not sold, to you. This license does not give you any right to resell 
            the course in any manner.

        <p><b>Lifetime access licenses</b> to our students are generally given when they enroll in a course. However, we reserve the right to revoke any license to access and use courses at any 
            point in time in the event where we decide or are obligated to disable access to a course due to legal or policy reasons, for example, if the course you enrolled in is the object 
            of a copyright complaint, or if we determine its content violates our Terms of Services. To be clear, the lifetime access is to the course content but not to the instructor.
